You will receive:  
1. The contents of several webpages.  
2. Several single-hop factual statements: S1, S2, ..., Sn.  

Your task is to determine whether each statement is **fully supported** by the provided webpage contents.  

For each statement:  
- Find the exact evidence from the webpage contents that supports or contradicts it.  
- Explain clearly why the statement **is** or **is not** fully supported, citing relevant parts of the provided text.  
- List the URLs of webpages where the supporting evidence was found.  
- Conclude with a judgment: **Fully Supported: yes** or **Fully Supported: no**.  

At the end, summarize your results in a JSON object mapping each statement label (S1, S2, …) to a boolean value (`true` for fully supported, `false` for not fully supported).  


**Output Format:**  

## Supportness Analysis of S1  
Explanation: {{Clearly explain why S1 is or is not fully supported according to the given webpage contents}}  
Evidence URLs: {{List of URLs containing evidence used in your explanation}}  
Fully Supported: {{yes/no}}  

## Supportness Analysis of S2  
Explanation: {{Clearly explain why S2 is or is not fully supported according to the given webpage contents}}  
Evidence URLs: {{List of URLs containing evidence used in your explanation}}  
Fully Supported: {{yes/no}}  

...  

## Final JSON-format Summary  
```json
{{
    "S1": {{true/false}},
    "S2": {{true/false}},
    "S3": {{true/false}},
    ...
}}
```
