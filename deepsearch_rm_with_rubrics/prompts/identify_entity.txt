**Task Description**  
You will receive the following inputs:  
1. **A complex multi-hop question**.  
2. **A list of single-hop constraints**, decomposed from the original question.  
   - The final answer entity is labeled as <E0>.  
   - Intermediate entities are labeled as <E1>, <E2>, <E3>, and so on.  
3. **An AI assistant’s response** to the multi-hop question.

**Your Task**  
Extract the **explicitly stated real identities** of <E0>, <E1>, <E2>, … from the assistant’s response. Provide an analysis first, then return a JSON object with one key per entity label:

---

**Output Format**  

## Analysis
{{Explain, for each entity label, whether the assistant’s response clearly and explicitly provides its real identity. State the actual name or value if it is explicitly mentioned; otherwise, indicate that the identity is not clearly stated.}}

## Final JSON-format Summary 
```json
{{
    "E0": {{actual identity from assistant's response or null}},
    "E1": {{actual identity from assistant's response or null}},
    "E2": {{actual identity from assistant's response or null}},
    ...
}}
```

---

**Important Rules**

- Only use information that is **explicitly and unambiguously stated** fin the assistant’s response.  
- **Do not infer, guess, or deduce entity identities** beyond what is explicitly provided.  
- If the assistant’s response does **not clearly identify** an entity, set its value to `null`.  
- Follow the output format exactly.
